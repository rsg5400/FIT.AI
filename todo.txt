  - keep in mind even if done well this will not be super accuate
  - could use a database with pure ingredients and have it guess based off that
  - for values that we don't have maybe we could just label them like: high in protein, high in fats, low in carbs, ...
  

- After we have infromation we can then train the LLM for the recommendation system
 
- look into free video recording studio for prototype

- there are going to hold office hours
