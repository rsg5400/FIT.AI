Sometime in 1986, one such fan mailed a postcard to our main office in Burlington, Vermont. Ice cream meets great guitar solos? We loved the idea, and Ben immediately began creating the iconic concoction. Cherry Garcia debuted in 1987 and quickly became one of our top three most popular flavors. But just as every good musician has to evolve, Ben & Jerry's does, too. So in answer to queries from all of those air-guitar heroes who can't or choose not to eat dairy, we decided it was time to create this fan favorite into a non-dairy ice cream and it's 100% vegan. It's made with smooth and creamy almond milk, which is the perfect blank canvas for the cherries and fudge flakes we pack into this pint. Same euphoria, minus the dairy—and here's hoping it inspires at least a few soulful guitar riffs powered by this non-dairy ice cream
